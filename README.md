Wordpress Semantic Engine
===============

Wordpress Semantic Engine is a plugin that aims to give some help to theme developers and web master who care about semantic and web 3.0 but don't have enough coding skills. 

Beyond that, is quite a powerful tool for creating and managing custom post types and custom fields through a user interface 

Essentially, what it *now does* for the backend is:
- store custom post types(CPT) data in a table which will be queried everytime
- store custom fields data in a table - then select fields by content types
- create admin UI to manage both CPTs and custom fields

In progress: view engine for single, page e category template. Eventually this view mode will support microdata schema according to schema.org

Changelog
===============

18/6/12
Supports custom post types, including a number of variables such as plural title, single title, position in admin sidebar, slug (url rewrite nicename), exclude from search and so on.

Support custom fields for CPTs. These mean you can create as many CF as you like choosing, for each one, an html widget - like select or radio button. These custom fields will be filled directly from add/edit page of a CPT, just under the wysiyg box.
Support multiple values for custom fields, like options in a select tag.

In progress: Support multiple entries for input text. For example, in a 'recipes' CPT you will be able to add as many ingredients as you wish.
